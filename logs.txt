I'm having issues to commit directly to main branch so I added the entire project in master branch.
Posts app is still in work, I'll get it done by evening.
I'm still figuring out -
raise InconsistentMigrationHistory(django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency reddit_api.0001_initial on database 'default'. 
this issue. This is not allowing me to migrate.
